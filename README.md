This repository contains the source code for [Hero of Allacrost](http://allacrost.org/). Hero of Allacrost is a free-to-play 2D single-player role playing game written in C++ and Lua. It is created using a custom-built game engine and map editor. Releases are supported for Linux, OS X, and Windows, and it has been ported to other systems such as FreeBSD as well. Allacrost is designed in the image of classic console RPGs where our focus is on a compelling story and engaging gameplay.

The true home of this project lives not here on Github, but rather at this [BitBucket project page](https://bitbucket.org/allacrost/allacrost/). This Github repository contains a copy of the build and source files, but not any of the media files. There are a few reasons why I copied this code over to Github.

1. A major disadvantage of BitBucket is that it is difficult for potential contributors to naturally discover.
2. The code and its accompanying documentation are a great source of learning, and I wanted to better share that as well. 
3. This project is where I personally make the majority of my open source contributions and I want my Github profile to reflect this.

If you're interested in learning more about the project, read on and you'll find links to further details. If you're intrigued about this type of project but adamant about only contributing within the Github community, consider having a look at [Valyria Tear](https://github.com/ValyriaTear/ValyriaTear). This is another great RPG project with many similarities to Allacrost, as it was built from a fork of Allacrost several years ago.
